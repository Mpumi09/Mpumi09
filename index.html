        <p><i><b>The times, they are changing</b></i><br>
            Gone are the days when elecricity was just used for a few things in a household. Nowadays almost everything is electronic, from your geyser down to your smart phone.The demand for electricity is on an all time high as new innovations and technologies imerge in the fourth industrial revolution.<br>With that being said a third of South Africans still do not have access to electricity, this alone makes it impossible for them to play part in the fourth industrial revolution.

            <h2>Solution!</h2>
            <i><b>Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be converted from one form to another.</b></i>
            <p>There is theoretically an inexhuastable supply of <abbr title="Energy Resulting from the use of another form of energy">waste energy</abbr>., and fractions of it may be harvested. This is great news and the world can benefit from building devices that can harvest this <abbr title="Energy Resulting from the use of another form of energy">waste energy</abbr>.<br>

        <h2>Piezoelectric energy harvesting platform</h2>
        <p>Piezoelectric materials are crystals that generate electricity when compressed or vibrated; by utilising these materials and embedding them on a flat platform, we can harness energy by placing this flat platform where crowds of people walk. A community can than be enabled to generate their own electricity while performing their everyday activities.<br>Now the question of efficiency arises, the good thing is that engineering modifications can be made on these flat platforms to increase power density. The piezoelectric energy harvesting platform is best placed in areas with high-traffic flow rates to maximize energy generation. Since these platforms are for communities who do not have access to electricity and/or communities that don't have a stable supply of electricity, the following are attributes of the system: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Easily implemented.</li>
            <li>Utilize property or infrastructure already developed.</li>
            <li>The platform will be connected to an inverter which can connect the energy generated to the electrical system.</li></ul><br><br>
             
  
        
     One average person walking across the platform can generate enough power to light-up a bulb for 5 seconds.This means that we can store a lot of power from people walking on this platform and get a step further in solving our energy problem.<br>
        See it for yourself, walk across the platform below and witness the energy!!!<br>
            Press the "step on the platform" button than press on the "step off the platform" below to simulate what would happen as you walk on a part of the platform.
        <br>
        
        <button onclick="changeim()">Step on the platform</button>
            <img id='myImage' src ="off.png">
            
            
            <button onclick = "changeImage()">Step off the platform</button>
        
         
               
    <script language =javascript>
        function changeImage() { (document.getElementById("myImage").src= "on2.png");}
        function changeim() { (document.getElementById("myImage").src = "off.png" ) ;}
